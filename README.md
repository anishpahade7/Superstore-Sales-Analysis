## Author - Anish Pahade

## Problem Statement:

“The Sales in a Supermarket store depends on a number
of factors; in this project we have tried analysing the effect
of a few of these factors and hence predicting sales.”

## Objectives:

Our objectives are to analyse the data, finding different
trends and finally answering the following questions: -
1. What is the overall sales trend?
2. Which are the Top 10 products by sales?
3. Which are the Most Selling Products
4. Which is the most preferred Ship Mode
5. Which are the Most Profitable Category and Sub-
Category?

## Dataset:

The data set used has been taken from Kaggle.com and contains three tables namely Orders, Return and People. The dataset has been cleaned of null and unreliable values and pre-processed. The data has three years of sales with more than 50000 rows and 21 columns.

## Visvualizations performed in Power-Bi:


### 1. Count of order_id by Country and Category
